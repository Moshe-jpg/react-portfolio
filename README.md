# Moshe's React Portfolio

My portfolio site is built using a react frontend that loads each page conditionally. It's a single page application which will only display the desired page you select from the menu. Each of the portfolio items and skills in the skill section render through a map of an array. The code is highly reusable and responsive and follows best practices despite being on the 2nd time I've used react to creat a site.
