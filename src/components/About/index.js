        Hi I'm Moshe.
        <br></br>
        Full Stack Web Developer with a passion for Front End Development
      </h2>
      <p>I started my Web Development career path in 2020 with an <a href="https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/en/intro-web-development-course?gclid=Cj0KCQjwj7CZBhDHARIsAPPWv3eqoPJ7V9hJQsoIZmU6g6tFOQELBQO_oZmCRSEci_MjC6HHY3TED6MaAjjnEALw_wcB">intro course</a> provided by <a href="https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/">Lighthouse Labs</a>
      . This sparked my interest in creating functional, attractive websites from the ground up. Upon completion I decided to upgrade
       my skills by taking <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/">The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp
       </a> provided by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/angela-yu1/">Dr. Angela Yu</a> through <a href="https://www.londonappbrewery.com/">App Brewery</a>.
       I then enrolled in <a href="https://learn.utoronto.ca/programs-courses/courses/3440-uoft-scs-coding-boot-camp">Full Stack Coding Bootcamp</a> provided by <a href="http://learn.utoronto.ca/">University of Toronto</a>.
       This is where my understanding and creativity took off, and I began implementing Full Scale websites under the Bootcamps direction.</p>
